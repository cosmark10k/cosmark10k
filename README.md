- 👋 Hi, I’m @cosmark10k
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new languages and expanding my growth.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and practicing Python, as it is a language that intrigued me the most.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project, just for fun. Do note that I am still junior level, as I don't exactly have many years of job experience (yes, I've worked as a software developer, at some point!).
- 📫 How to reach me:
  Email: wffs18official1@gmail.com
